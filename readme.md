# The WoW Decider

The **WoW Decider** is a lighthearted, browser-based JavaScript app that helps World of Warcraft players decide what to do next. Built as part of Codecademy’s Full-Stack Engineer path, this project began as a simple randomizer assignment but maybe got away from me a little bit.

## Notes

This project started as a randomizer assignment — and ended up being a love letter to early-2000s gaming - and Geocities - nostalgia. It’s overkill for the assignment, but if you're going to do a "portfolio project," it might as well be a good one.
